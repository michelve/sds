# Architecture Decisions

## 🏗️ Technical Design Decisions for SDS Bootstrap Mapper

This document records the key architectural decisions made during the design of the Bootstrap mapper system, including rationale and trade-offs considered.

## 🎯 Decision Record Format

Each decision includes:
- **Context**: Why this decision was needed
- **Options**: Alternatives considered  
- **Decision**: What was chosen
- **Rationale**: Why this option was selected
- **Consequences**: Trade-offs and implications

## Decision 01: Style Dictionary Extension vs. Separate Tool

**Context**: Need to generate Bootstrap SCSS overrides from SDS tokens.

**Options Considered**:
1. Extend existing Style Dictionary setup
2. Create separate, standalone mapping tool
3. Build custom token transformation pipeline

**Decision**: Extend existing Style Dictionary setup

**Rationale**:
- Leverages existing token processing infrastructure
- Maintains consistency with current build process
- Reuses existing transforms and preprocessors
- Minimizes new dependencies and maintenance overhead

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Faster development and integration
- ✅ Consistent with existing patterns
- ❌ Some Style Dictionary limitations may constrain advanced features
- ❌ Tied to Style Dictionary's API changes

---

## Decision 02: Mapping Configuration Format

**Context**: Need flexible way to define SDS → Bootstrap variable mappings.

**Options Considered**:
1. JSON configuration file
2. JavaScript/ES module with functions
3. YAML configuration
4. Hardcoded mappings in transforms

**Decision**: JavaScript/ES module configuration

**Rationale**:
- Supports complex mapping logic (calculations, conditions)
- Allows inline documentation and comments
- Enables dynamic mapping based on token analysis
- Provides better IDE support and validation

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Maximum flexibility for complex mappings
- ✅ Strong typing and validation possible
- ✅ Version control friendly
- ❌ Requires JavaScript knowledge to customize
- ❌ Slightly more complex than static JSON

---

## Decision 03: Semantic vs. Primitive Token Mapping

**Context**: SDS has both primitive (color-blue-500) and semantic (color-primary) tokens.

**Options Considered**:
1. Map primitive tokens directly to Bootstrap
2. Map semantic tokens to Bootstrap
3. Mixed approach with preferences

**Decision**: Semantic token mapping with primitive fallback

**Rationale**:
- Bootstrap variables are inherently semantic ($primary, not $blue-500)
- Maintains design intent and consistency
- Easier for developers to understand and customize
- Provides clear upgrade path as semantic tokens evolve

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Maintains design system semantics
- ✅ Bootstrap-native approach
- ✅ Future-proof for token evolution
- ❌ May miss some primitive token nuances
- ❌ Requires well-structured semantic token layer

---

## Decision 04: Spacing System Transformation Approach

**Context**: Bootstrap uses multiplicative spacing ($spacer * 0.5) while SDS uses absolute values.

**Options Considered**:
1. Convert SDS values to rem and ignore Bootstrap's system
2. Calculate multipliers based on SDS base unit
3. Override Bootstrap's $spacers map directly
4. Mixed approach with base unit detection

**Decision**: Calculate multipliers with configurable base unit

**Rationale**:
- Preserves Bootstrap's systematic spacing approach
- Allows customization of base spacing unit
- Maintains relationship between spacing values
- Enables use of Bootstrap's spacing utilities

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Maintains Bootstrap spacing system benefits
- ✅ Preserves proportional relationships
- ✅ Compatible with Bootstrap utilities
- ❌ Requires accurate base unit identification
- ❌ Complex when SDS spacing isn't proportional

---

## Decision 05: Build Integration Strategy

**Context**: Need to integrate Bootstrap generation into existing build process.

**Options Considered**:
1. Replace existing Style Dictionary build
2. Add as parallel build target  
3. Post-processing step after main build
4. Separate npm script/command only

**Decision**: Add as parallel build target with separate commands

**Rationale**:
- Non-breaking integration with existing workflow
- Optional - teams can choose when to use Bootstrap output
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easy to test and validate independently

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Zero risk to existing functionality
- ✅ Gradual adoption possible
- ✅ Clear opt-in model
- ❌ Potential for build processes to drift
- ❌ Additional build time when enabled

---

## Decision 06: Error Handling and Fallbacks

**Context**: Some SDS tokens may not have clear Bootstrap equivalents.

**Options Considered**:
1. Fail build when unmapped tokens found
2. Skip unmapped tokens silently
3. Generate fallback variables with SDS prefix
4. Warn but continue with best-effort mapping

**Decision**: Generate fallback variables with warnings

**Rationale**:
- Graceful degradation maintains build stability
- Fallback variables preserve all token information
- Warnings provide visibility into mapping gaps
- Allows iterative improvement of mapping coverage

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Robust build process
- ✅ No token information lost
- ✅ Clear visibility into mapping completeness
- ❌ May generate unused variables
- ❌ Requires discipline to address warnings

---

## Decision 07: Framework Abstraction Level

**Context**: Plan to support multiple frameworks (Tailwind, Material UI) in future.

**Options Considered**:
1. Bootstrap-specific implementation only
2. Generic framework abstraction from start
3. Bootstrap implementation with extension points
4. Completely separate tools per framework

**Decision**: Bootstrap implementation with planned extension points

**Rationale**:
- Delivers immediate value for Bootstrap use case
- Avoids over-engineering before requirements clear
- Identifies abstraction needs through real implementation
- Maintains flexibility for future framework support

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Faster time to value for Bootstrap users
- ✅ Real-world testing of architecture
- ✅ Informed abstraction design
- ❌ May require refactoring for multi-framework support
- ❌ Risk of Bootstrap-specific assumptions

---

## Decision 08: Validation and Testing Strategy

**Context**: Need to ensure generated Bootstrap overrides work correctly.

**Options Considered**:
1. Syntax validation only (SCSS compilation)
2. Integration testing with real Bootstrap builds
3. Visual regression testing with Bootstrap components
4. Comprehensive multi-level testing

**Decision**: Comprehensive multi-level testing strategy

**Rationale**:
- Bootstrap integration is mission-critical feature
- Multiple failure modes possible (syntax, semantics, visual)
- High confidence needed for production adoption
- Investment in testing enables rapid iteration

**Consequences**:
- ✅ High confidence in generated output
- ✅ Catches regressions early
- ✅ Enables safe refactoring and optimization
- ❌ Significant upfront testing investment
- ❌ Ongoing test maintenance overhead

---

## Decision 09: Documentation Generation Strategy

**Context**: Developers need guidance on using generated Bootstrap overrides.

**Options Considered**:
1. Static documentation only
2. Generated integration guides based on mappings
3. Interactive examples and previews
4. Comprehensive multi-format documentation

**Decision**: Generated documentation with examples

**Rationale**:
- Documentation stays synchronized with implementation
- Examples provide clear integration guidance
- Generated content reduces maintenance overhead
- Multiple formats serve different use cases

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Always up-to-date documentation
- ✅ Clear integration guidance
- ✅ Reduced manual maintenance
- ❌ Complex documentation generation logic
- ❌ Potential for generated content quality issues

---

## Decision 10: Version Compatibility Strategy

**Context**: Need to handle different Bootstrap versions and SDS evolution.

**Options Considered**:
1. Support latest Bootstrap version only
2. Support multiple Bootstrap versions simultaneously  
3. Versioned mapping configurations
4. Runtime version detection and adaptation

**Decision**: Bootstrap 5.3.x focus with versioned configuration structure

**Rationale**:
- 5.3.x is current stable Bootstrap version
- Versioned config enables future multi-version support
- Focused scope enables thorough implementation
- Clear upgrade path for future versions

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Thorough support for current Bootstrap version
- ✅ Clear version compatibility expectations
- ✅ Structured for future multi-version support
- ❌ Limited Bootstrap version flexibility initially
- ❌ Version upgrade may require mapping updates
