# 🚀 How Code Connect Speeds Up AI Coding

## Overview

Figma Code Connect bridges the gap between design and development by creating direct mappings between Figma components and React code. When combined with design token automation, it creates a powerful workflow where **Figma becomes the single source of truth** for your entire design system.

## 🔗 What is Figma Code Connect?

Code Connect creates **exact mappings** between Figma components and your React codebase:

```tsx
// Instead of AI guessing:
<button className="primary-button">Click me</button>

// AI gets exact mapping:
<Button variant="primary" size="medium" onPress={() => {}}>
  Click me
</Button>
```

## 🎯 Figma as Single Source of Truth

### The Token Generator Workflow

```mermaid
Figma Design Tokens → REST API → JSON Processing → CSS Variables → theme.css
```

1. **Design in Figma**: Colors, typography, spacing defined as variables
2. **Token Sync Script**: `npm run script:tokens:rest`
3. **Auto-Generated CSS**: Creates `src/theme.css` with all design tokens
4. **Code Connect**: Maps Figma components to React components

### Automated Sync Benefits

- **🔄 Single Command**: `npm run script:tokens:rest` updates everything
- **🎨 Design Consistency**: Always matches Figma exactly
- **📱 Responsive Ready**: Automatic rem conversion and breakpoints
- **🌓 Theme Support**: Light/dark mode built-in
- **💯 Error-Free**: No manual copy-paste mistakes

## 🚀 Speed Benefits for AI Coding

### 1. **Context-Aware Component Selection**

**Before Code Connect:**
```json
// MCP returns raw Figma data
{
  "type": "RECTANGLE", 
  "fills": [{"color": {"r": 0.2, "g": 0.2, "b": 0.2}}],
  "text": "Submit"
}
```

**After Code Connect:**
```tsx
// MCP returns actual React code
<Button variant="primary" size="medium">
  Submit
</Button>
```

### 2. **Automatic Token Integration**

AI automatically uses design tokens instead of hardcoded values:

```tsx
// ❌ Without tokens
<div style={{ background: "#2c2c2c", padding: "16px" }}>

// ✅ With tokens  
<Section padding="400" variant="brand">
```

### 3. **Component Composition Knowledge**

AI understands how SDS components work together:

```tsx
<Section padding="600">
  <Flex direction="column" gap="400" container>
    <Navigation>
      <NavigationPill isSelected>Products</NavigationPill>
    </Navigation>
    <Flex type="third" gap="400">
      {products.map(product => 
        <Card key={product.id} {...product} />
      )}
    </Flex>
  </Flex>
</Section>
```

## 💡 Key Advantages

| Task | Without Code Connect | With Code Connect |
|------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Component Selection** | AI guesses generic `<div>` | AI uses exact `<Card>` |
| **Prop Discovery** | Manual API reading | Auto-mapped from Figma |
| **Import Paths** | AI guesses imports | Configured aliases |
| **Design Tokens** | Hardcoded values | Automatic variables |
| **Responsive Design** | Manual breakpoints | Built-in patterns |

## 🔧 Setup Commands

### Token Sync
```bash
# Fetch fresh tokens from Figma
npm run script:tokens:rest

# Process cached tokens (faster for development)
npm run script:tokens
```

### VS Code Tasks
```
Cmd+Shift+P → "Tasks: Run Task" → "Sync Design Tokens (with REST API)"
```

## 🎯 For AI Agents

Code Connect makes AI agents **exponentially more effective** because:

1. **🧠 Context Understanding**: AI knows exactly what each Figma element should become
2. **🔄 Consistency**: Every AI suggestion uses the same component patterns  
3. **⚡ Speed**: No guesswork - direct Figma → React translation
4. **🎯 Accuracy**: Matches design tokens and responsive patterns automatically

## 📋 Result

With this workflow, **Figma becomes your design system's single source of truth**:
- Designers update colors/spacing in Figma
- Run one command to sync tokens
- AI coding tools automatically use updated values
- Perfect design-development consistency

This creates a seamless pipeline from design to production code! 🎨→💻
