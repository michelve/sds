Use #mcp_talktofigma_join_channel jhyz571y, then #mcp_talktofigma_get_local_components to find component keys, find the component with id "5:405" and name "variant=Elevated Card, showDivider=true, showButton=true" and get its key value, then use #mcp_talktofigma_create_component_instance with that componentKey x=50 y=50 to create a Card instance.
